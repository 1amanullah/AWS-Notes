# IAM (Identity Access Managment)
- IAM is responsible for Authentication and Authorization.
- Authentication (The right user).
- Authorization (The right access).

  ## Authentication:
    - Authentication means is it a right user.
  ## Authorization:
    - Authorization means does the user has right access.
## Rootuser:
  - User we created our AWS account with follow:
     - Credentials Email address and password.
     - Do Not use Rootuser for day-to-day activities.
     - Create a new IAM account and use the IAM user for the regular activities.
    
## Things we will do now:
  - Create on IAM Group_Developers with admin access.
  - The group which we create is called developers.
  - Create an IAM user with group Developers.
  - We make it part of IAM Group Developers.
